            <p>One accomplishment I have with Music is I got first chair In my Band clas. 
            One of my favorite artists is Kali Uchis.
            Although she is more modern my favorite type of music are oldies/older. Music that was made in the 1950-70's are my favorite. 
            Another one of my favorite artists is the Delfonics. They are an early R&B group that made their debut in the late 1960's. 
            Two of my favorite songs are "Hey! love" and "La-La Means I Love You".</p>
